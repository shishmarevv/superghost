## About

**Ghost Game - Reinforcement Learning Edition** is developed in Go and brings together classic gameplay mechanics with modern AI and multi-platform interfaces.

With multiple versions like Superghost and other variants planned, the game promises both casual fun and strategic depth.

This project aims to explore:
- **Interactive UI/UX**: A desktop GUI application for an immersive experience.
